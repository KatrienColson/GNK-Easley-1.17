# Rules

Here at BeCode, we try to create a professional environment for all of you to learn new technical skills and improve your existing ones. That means that we have some rules in place to ensure everyone behaves professionally!

## Be on time and respect the planning!

The training runs from Monday to Friday, from 9h00 - 17h00 (you can see the general timetable below). One of the goals of our training is to prepare the junior, you, for a realistic work environment. As such, we ask that you are punctual in everything you have to do.

### Rules in class

* Arrive on time for the training!
* Turn in assignments before the deadline!
* When you are late, wait until the next break to enter the class. (Also inform your coaches!)
* If you are absent, any backlog is your responsibility.
* If there is any backlog, work on it in your **free time**!

## Whenever you are absent

It is important that you have an official document stating the reason for your absence (e.g. a doctor's note) and that you share it with us through our platform ([my.becode.org](https://my.becode.org/)). These official documents are important for you and us. If you do not have an official document for your absence, your absence will be seen as "playing hooky".

Secondly, whenever you are absent, official reasons or not, let us know **ASAP**, that way we at least know what's up.
### Rules for absences

* Inform of your absence *at least* a day in advance!
* Upload your official documents within the same week.
* Being absent for silly reasons like collecting post, shopping,ect.. is unacceptable.

***Note:** Not following these rules will have consequences!*

## Take care of your learn & work environment!

While these rules seem straightforward, we'll mention them anyway for good measure:
* Don't leave a mess behind when you leave.
* Put away the equipment you used throughout the day.
* Have respect for eachother and their stuff.
* Stay motivated!
