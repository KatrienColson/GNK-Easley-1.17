# Rules

Here at BeCode, we try to create a professional environment for all of you to learn new technical skills and improve your existing ones. That means that we have some rules in place to ensure everyone behaves professionally!

## Be on time and respect the planning!

The training runs from Monday to Friday, from 9h00 - 17h00 (you can see the general timetable below). One of the goals of our training is to prepare the junior, you, for a realistic work environment. As such, we ask that you are punctual in everything you have to do.

### Rules in class

* Arrive on time for the training!
* Turn in assignments before the deadline!
* When you are late, wait until the next break to enter the class. (Also inform your coaches!)
* If you are absent, any backlog is your responsibility.
* If there is any backlog, work on it in your **free time**!

## Whenever you are absent

It is important that you have an official document stating the reason for your absence (e.g. a doctor's note) and that you share it with us through our platform ([my.becode.org](https://my.becode.org/)). These official documents are important for you and us. If you do not have an official document for your absence, your absence will be seen as "playing hooky".

### Rules for absences

* Inform of your absence *at least* a day in advance!
* Upload your official documents within the same week.
* Being absent for silly reasons like collecting post, shopping,ect.. is unacceptable.

***Note:** Not following these rules will have consequences!*

## Take care of your learn & work environment!

While these rules seem straightforward, we'll mention them anyway for good measure:
* Don't leave a mess behind when you leave.
* Put away the equipment you used throughout the day.
* Have respect for eachother and their stuff.
* Stay motivated!
