# Main Course


## Git setup
So from [markup](./2.markup) to the end of this course basically, we're going to use a specific structure and organisation towards our github profile / repositories.
Continue reading below once you have reached the **markup checkpoint**. 

#### Markup and beyond... 
Create a repository with the name of the chapter you're working on prepended by learning (i.e. `learning-markup`).

The repository should have the following files / folders:
- A **readme.md** `(the main readme for your repository)`
- A folder called **exercises** `(to put all the chapter folders in)`
    - A folder for every chapter `(to put all the exercise folders in)`
- An **index.html** `(for the published version of your repository's navigation page)`
- A folder called **resources** `(for any resources of your published version of the repository)`

Every exercise we do, will have a `repository-folder` in it's header table of it's readme. This folder is one that you create, to put
all the exercise's files in. For example an exercise says in the header table:

|Challenge Parameters  |Challenge Details              |
|:---------------------|:------------------------------|
|Repository Folder     |`1.javascript-to-php`          |

Then you are supposed to have the following structure:

- exercises **(folder)**
    - php **(chapter folder)**
        - 1.javascript-to-php **(exercise folder)**
            - Files and folders as requested in the readme **(exercise files)**
        - ... **(other exercise's folders)**
        

Make sure you set this up before continuing on the exercises




## Challenge types 

### Learning challenges
These challenges are for you to learn new things, they are meant to be played around with, try out things with.
They will also not be put in the spotlight, they will be on your account to show your future (possible) employers what path you took and what you learned.
Generally speaking though, they will attract less attention than the other type of challenges, so feel free to experiment with these challenges' code.

### Consolidation challenges 
These challenges have two purposes:
- Show your employer you know what's up, show off your awesome coding skills
- Show **you** how awesome your coding skills can be !

A little bit more explanation is due... 

On the one hand, you need to be able to show your employer, that you can in fact, code like a pro. As a junior webdeveloper, applying for a job / internship
with any company requires you to have at least one work piece you can show them. These consolidation challenges will get their own repository so they can be showed off on
interviews. 

Make sure your code in these projects is impeccable, it should be a final product you are 100% pleased with. Didn't get to finish it properly during the period you're allowed
to work on it ? Then just finish it whenever you have time free during the education or at home!
These projects will be the pillars on which you build your case towards the company you want to work for ! <br/>
(don't worry at the end of the course, there'll be some time to rework some of these if you'd want to) 

On the other hand, you need to understand, and sometimes we need to stress this out a bit, that you **are** a good (junior) web developer.
Lots of people in this sector have imposter syndrome, we don't want you to have that, if you're not sure about your skills, use these projects to test yourself, 
was it easy, was it difficult? Ask your coaches what they think about how difficult you had it, ...
