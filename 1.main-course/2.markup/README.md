# Markup

## Introduction
The first part of this education's course is `markup` languages, these languages are scripting languages.
This basically means that these languages don't offer any programming as of yet, rather they allow you to structure and style content on webpages.
So, we're going to start by writing content, after this, we'll write programming code to access, change and create the very same content.

## Subjects

### Markdown
You've secretly learned one of the markup languages already, markdown.
This language is a simplified version of `HTML` made by an open sourced developer to create an easy way to write readable
text documents in a scripting manner.

### HTML
This is the big one, `HTML` , this is used for **all** webpages, no matter how small or how big it is, this is the one language to rule them all..
We're going to learn what `HTML` is, what it does and how to code in it. 

### CSS 
`CSS` is the language that works closely together with `HTML`. It adds all forms of styling to `HTML`. 
So CSS = Styling, HTML = Content. 


### SASS
Sass is basically CSS with some minor programming added onto it, use loops, variables, etc to make a expandable self-writing css library.

### Project **Markup**
Just like any chapter in this course, we will end with a challenge that will leave you with a presentable project, with which you can go to 
internship options and companies, to showcase them your skills.


## Goals
- [ ] Understand how you can make a webpage from start to finish
- [ ] Know what HTML, CSS, SASS are and what they do
- [ ] Be able to code most things in these languages without having to look up everything
- [ ] Master the individual goals in the individual exercises
