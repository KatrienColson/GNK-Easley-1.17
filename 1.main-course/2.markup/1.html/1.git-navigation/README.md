## Instructions
We're going to make an `HTML` file that will allow us to navigate through all our html files on the published version of your github repository.


## Exercise
1. Add an `index.html` file to the root folder of your repository (the root folder is not one you create, it's the main folder)
1. Change your github publishing settings to point to this file.
1. Google or [Hoehel](https://hoehel.be/) how you can make links and lists in HTML.
1. Then make a list of links, that point to the different exercise's folders. (this way you can easily navigate to the published version of your exercise's files) 
1. You can already add the future folders / files of the exercises so they will all be automatically accessible as well. (bonus)


## Goals

After this chapter, you should have acquired the following skills/competencies:

- [ ] Able to understand how links and navigation work.
- [ ] Have a clear understanding of what github pages (publishing) really is.
