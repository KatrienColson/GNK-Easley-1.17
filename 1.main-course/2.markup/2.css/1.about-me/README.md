## A first word:

CSS is a very crucial part of a web page. It ensures that all the information on a page is displayed nicely.  
Every page on the internet has a CSS file (except for https://motherfuckingwebsite.com/).

## Before you begin:

Go through some of these small games, they will help you alot along the way.

- CSS selectors: https://flukeout.github.io/
- CSS flex-box: http://flexboxfroggy.com/#nl
- CSS flex-box: http://www.flexboxdefense.com/

## Exercise:
Create an HTML page in which you give a small explanation about yourself.  
*Note: By following the instructions below.*

### Section 1: the header
We're going to make a nice header, in which we are going to introduce you.  
This ensures that when the page is loaded, we immediately know who, what or where.

<details><summary>Collapse to see the steps of section 1!</summary>

#### Step 1:  
Create a `<header>`and insert a text, containing your *life quote* inside of it.  
This quote should have a very light grey color, use a **hex** color for this.

#### Step 2:  
Add a background image to the `<header>` and make sure the header's height is the same size as your *view height*.

#### Step 3:  
Make the image darker, so that it fits with the text.

#### Step 4:  
Make sure the text is centered in the middle of the screen.  
*Tip: look up flexbox.*

#### Step 5:  
Add an image of yourself above your quote. This should be a round image.  
`Note: The  rounding must be done in css.`

#### Step 6:  
Make sure that when you hover your mouse over the image, it becomes a bit blurry and slightly *larger. 
*Larger: Circle size stays the same, but the content image scales*

#### Step 7:  
Make sure that your age is displayed on the image when you hover over it.

#### Step 8:  
Add your name between the image and the quote.

#### Step 9:  
Use google fonts to add a new font-family. Style all your text on the page, make it beautiful!</details>

### Section 2: the section

In our next challenge, we are going to make a table in which we keep a Q&A for you and your colleagues.
In the table head we will find the questions, the rows will contain you and your colleagues answers.   
(Ask your colleagues their answers via Ryver. *Atleast 4 questions.*)

Questions:
1. What did you do before BeCode?
1. Why do you want to become a Web Developer?
1. What is your biggest dream?
1. What do you expect from your colleagues?
1. What do you expect from the training?
1. Is there something we should know about you?

<details><summary>Collapse to see the steps of section 2!</summary>

#### Step 1:
Create a table and fill it with all the information.

#### Step 2: 
Remove the horizontal lines from the table.

#### Step 3:
Make a striped table (example: dark grey/light grey.).  
*Tip: css selectors*

#### Step 4:
If the user moves his mouse over a 'td', the background colour must change.  
*Note: If the background is light it should turn darker, if not it should turn lighter.*

#### Step 5:
Each first letter in the `<td>` must have a **bold** font weight.  
*Tip: css selectors*

### Section 3: The footer

This is our last challenge, we are going to make a footer with extra information about yourself.  
*Info: In this section you will not find any tips.*

Information:  
- Link to LinkedIn.
- Link to GitHub
- Link to StackOverflow

All these links must be displayed as icons.

<details><summary>Collapse to see the steps of section 3!</summary>

#### Step 1:
Create a `<footer>` and give it a height of 150px.

#### Step 2:
Create a `<ul>` with the following sturcture `<ul>` -> `<li>` -> `<i>`. Center this in the footer.

#### Step 3: 
Add icons that contain the URLs. And make sure that they are spread in a width of 400px.

#### Step 4:
Animate the icons color on hover.

#### Step 5:
Before the first icon and after the last icon, there should be a vertical line `|`.

## Bonus:

### Section 4: The nav-bar
Create a nav-bar at the top of the page.
This page should have links to fictional pages.
Make this navbar as beautiful as you can and prove to yourself that you already understand HTML & CSS!  
Note: If we move the mouse over the buttons, the letters should get a moving animation. (rotate/scale/...).  
Be creative!
