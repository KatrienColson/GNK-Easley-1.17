## Exercise
A portfolio is your first impression. It is very important to create something that the companies will remember.  
Create a multi-pager where we can find information about you and the projects you worked on.  

Your website should contain atleast two pages :

- home.html
- cv.html

*Note: You are free to split the **home.html** into more pages.*

**Step 1:**  
Lookup multiple online portfolios, write down what you like & what you dislike. Take some as a reference to create your own.

**Step 2:**  
Take a piece of paper and draw out a wireframe (A rough layout of the pages of your website.).  
It  will help you to stay consistent with your idea during development.

**Step 3:**  
Create your HTML files and populate them with the needed information.

**Step 4:**  
Use Sass to style your pages, and make them attractive for the eye, make sure to stick to your wireframe reference.

**Step 5:**  
Check if there is any lack of relevant information that you should share.

**Step 6:**  
Publish your website on GitHub and run an Audit.  
(**Device**: Mobile, **Audits**: all checked & **Throttling**: Simulated Slow 4G,4x CPU Slowdown).

**Step 7:**  
Update your website with the feedback you have gotten from Audits, do your best to get your scores higher than 95 for each section, or even 100.
