## Exercise

I will supply an `index.html` and a `styles.css` file, open these in your browser / on your server.
Once opened, read and try to understand what the javascript code does / see what happens when you disable it.
Then write the same functionality in `PHP`.



### Rules of the game
* **No Javascript is allowed on the page anymore**
* Use `PHP` to write the same functionality as what the javascript had
* Your `PHP` should at least have the following code:
    * a loop
    * a condition
    * variables
* Your page has to look exactly the same as the initial JS build.
