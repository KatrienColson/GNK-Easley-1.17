## Introduction
Debugging is the pinpoint to being a master in any coding language.  
Everyone gets errors, but the best programmers never let it stop them and they find a way to fix it every time!
I scoured the internet for a debugging guide, that I felt like I could get behind and here it is: [The guide](https://rollbar.com/guides/how-to-debug-php/)

This is what I feel like doing when coding `PHP` that doesn't mean that this should be your way. Discover, look up, research whatever ways work for you to debug you code!



### Exercise:
Open up the [index.php](resources/index.php) file, read the comments, fix the code blocks as requested in the comments
and put the final file in the repository folder as requested.

### Bonus Exercise:
If you feel up for the challenge and you want to test your bug fixing skills, 
go to [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com), create a profile for yourself and look up a subject your comfortable with.

Then, try to fix at least three issues on there for people.


 
## Goals
- [ ] understanding the root of bug fixing
- [ ] know what print_r, var_dump, die, echo, exit, break do
- [ ] know what to do the next time you're stuck
- [ ] give yourself the `solver's mentality`, a problem is just an opportunity to learn!
