## Instructions
Did you know you can do a lot of awesome stuff with the terminal ? 
For example, all Ubuntu users, type: `telnet towel.blinkenlights.nl`, press enter, sit back and
enjoy the show!

Let's look at some of the things we can use the terminal for ***(in Ubuntu or any other Ubuntu based OS'es)***

## Exercises
These exercises are meant to be done alone, think about what you do, how you do it and what you can learn from 
completing the individual challenges. A quiz will be done afterwards.


### Exercise 1:

1. Find out how to **upgrade** your PC
