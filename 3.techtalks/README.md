Techtalk
========

### How does it work?
---------------------

Everyday, one of the juniors chooses a topic with regards to web development. The juniors then gives a presentation about the topic. After the presentation, there will be a feedback session. 

Now it's up to you!

To make everything run smoothly, the juniors (you) are responsible for maintaining the [agenda.md](./agenda.md).
Remember, there should be a techtalk every day!

### Instructions
----------------

#### Via the terminal:  

1. Clone this repository / Pull the lastest updates.
1. Edit the [agenda.md](./agenda.md).
1. Add changes you want to stage. (Use `git add tech-talks` if want to limit potential damage!)
1. Commit with a relevant commit message.
1. Push the changes online.

_**Note:** Careful that you don't break the repository._ ;)

### Rules
---------

* You don't edit anyone else's information without their permission!
* You always use a relevant & professional commit message!
* You break it, you fix it! (Ask for help!)
* Any empty slots will be skipped!
* Everyone takes a turn before a new cycle begins!
