# Optional Challenges

## Setup

Create a repository named 'optional-challenges', recreate the folder structure from our main-course repository and store your exercises inside the `exercise` folder.

## Challenge types 

### Optional challenges
Sometimes you finish the assignments faster than planned. In this case, we provide optional challenges.  
These challenges are not always easy, but that's the purpose of these challenges: Challenge yourself and of course, learn more about certain subjects.  

By creating these challenges, you show future employers how motivated you are, and that you are not afraid, of larger / more difficult projects.
It also helps you, as a developer, to develop yourself and to strive for a high level of knowledge.

Good luck with the path you choose and remember: Ancora imparo.
